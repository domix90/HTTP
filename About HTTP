To make a request to a server I use : 

telnet httpbin.org 80  

Then I use GET (to make a request to fetch the CONTENT at the root "/" - thats why the single slash) / HTTP/1.1
(the protocol version used for the request is 1.1)  -- all this is called request line 

GET|POST[REQUEST LINE] / or /xml or any other resources[called URI] HTTP/1.1[VERSION]
Host: httpbin.org  + 2x space 

URI - uniform resource identifier

HEADERS [Header name] [Header Value]
each on its own line 

LIKE 

host: httpbin.org
User-Agent: telnet


JSON - javaScript object notation
